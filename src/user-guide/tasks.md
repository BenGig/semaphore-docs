# Tasks

A task is an instance of launching an Ansible playbook. You can create the task from [Task Template](task-templates/) by clicking the button Run/Build/Deploy for the required template.

The **Deploy** task type allows you to specify a version of the build associated with the task. By default, it is the latest build version.

When the task is running, or it has finished, you can see the task status and the running log.
